********************************

Welcome to the official manual of **ONELVXE Material Pipeline** (1LM).

1LM is a shading and texturing pipeline for creating photorealistic, PBR Materials in Blender 3D `Blender <http://www.blender.org/>`_.

This system allows you to quickly apply physically based rendering to materials in Blender 3D, using pre-created image textures and shading methods.
The pipeline constitutes 3 unique modules: The Studio Shader, ONELVXE Texture Bridge, and a large texture repository.
